# Space SHMUP
 Beginner Unity Project For CS-382


My biggest improvement in my opinion is the addition of audio sound effects for various activities. Including things like shooting, taking damage, losing, applying damage, and more. I think that the biggest thing I noticed when testing the game as I was making changes was how empty and unimpactful things felt without audio. The addition of audio to almost every interaction in the game has made an improvement in how responsive the overall experience feels. If I had to continue working on this project, I would add some sort of explosion VFX or flipbook to the death of each ship and the player. Then I would investigate if I could find simplistic music to play overtime that possibly grows in intensity the longer you survive as well as slowly increasing health / spawns of ships, indefinitely. Overall, this was a fun project, and I look forward to beginning work on our final group project.
